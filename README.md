# Job & Internship Portal – MongoDB Backend (Academic Team Project)

This repository documents my role in the backend development of a job & internship portal built as a college mini-project. I focused on designing the database using MongoDB and Mongoose in a Node.js environment.

---

## 🧩 My Role
As part of a 3-member team, I was responsible for:
- Designing MongoDB schemas for user accounts and job listings
- Planning collection structures for recruiters vs applicants
- Creating basic logic for auto-deleting expired job posts
- Drafting backend APIs for job creation, filtering, and profile storage

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Node.js
- Express.js (team usage)
- JavaScript

---

## 🧪 What I Learned
- How to structure NoSQL databases for real-world use cases
- Writing reusable schema modules with Mongoose
- Importance of data validation and relationship modeling in NoSQL

---

## 🚀 Future Plan (When Rebuilding)
If I were to rebuild this:
- [ ] Create RESTful endpoints for job and user management
- [ ] Add Mongoose schemas for jobs, users, and applications
- [ ] Write scripts to auto-remove expired posts
- [ ] Secure with JWT + role-based access control

---

## 📌 Note
This was an academic project without deployment. Code was not retained but the backend structure and database logic were implemented during development.
